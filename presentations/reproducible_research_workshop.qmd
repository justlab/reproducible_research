## Agenda and Goals

-   Project and data organization principles

-   Writing more reusable code

-   A quick tour of tools

-   Playing with Git

-   Data sharing

## What do we mean by Reproducible Research?

## Who is this for?

# Project Organization and Data Management

## *Good enough practices in scientific computing*

## Checking in on your data stewardship

## Version control with *`git`*

Motivation for using git

## Git in RStudio

## Interactive exercise with RStudio Cloud

## Working toward a reproducible toolkit

# Examples from our lab

## Analysis of public COVID-19 datasets

-   Complex analysis integrating multiple public data sources

-   Sharing the code plus output increases transparency

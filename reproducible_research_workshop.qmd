## Objective of the workshop

::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 1em"}
### To demonstrate how reproducible research practices make research easier and more transparent
:::

## Agenda

-   Project and data organization principles

-   Writing more reusable code

-   A quick tour of tools

-   Motivations and resources for Git/GitHub

-   Data sharing and NIH rules

    ::: aside
    With lots of examples from our lab
    :::

## What do we mean by Reproducible Research?

-   **Reproducibility:** You/someone else can exactly (numerically) regenerate your results on the same dataset
-   **Replicability:** getting similar results and reaching same conclusion with another dataset

## Who is this for?

-   **You** *(thanks for joining)*
-   Small teams working on science projects with data

## Reproducibility as a component of Scientific Rigor {.smaller}

For my NIH proposals, I use some version of the following text:

> **Scientific rigor and reproducibility:** We have several protocols in place to ensure rigor and reproducibility. In both exposure modeling and epidemiologic analyses, we use careful data cleaning, sanity checks and quality control. These protocols include (1) automated data quality checking using statistical reporting tools and audits; (2) prespecified analytic plans that are approved by the PI with mandated reporting of null results; (3) use of reproducible analytic tools such as R Markdown and Git repositories for statistical code; (4) required verification of analyses by a second data analyst; and (5) adherence to STROBE guidelines[^1] so that results are more likely interpretable and useful to the scientific and policy communities.

# Project Organization and Data Management

## Good enough practices - Data mgmt

-   Save the raw data.
-   Record all the steps used to process data.
-   Anticipate the need to use multiple data sources, and use a unique identifier for every record.
-   Submit data to a reputable DOI-issuing repository so that others can access and cite it.

:::

## Good enough practices *-* Software

-   Place a brief explanatory comment at the start of every program.
-   Decompose programs into functions.
-   Give functions and variables meaningful names.
-   Make dependencies and requirements explicit.
-   Do not comment and uncomment sections of code to control a program's behavior.
-   Provide a simple example or test data set.
-   Submit code to a reputable DOI-issuing repository.

:::

## Good enough practices *-* Collaboration

-   Create an overview of your project.
-   Create a shared "to-do" list for the project.
-   Decide on communication strategies.
-   Make the license explicit.
-   Make the project citable.

:::

## Good enough practices *-* Project organization

-   Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.
-   Put text documents associated with the project in the doc directory.
-   Put raw data and metadata in a data directory and files generated during cleanup and analysis in a results directory.
-   Put project source code in a designated directory.
-   Name all files to reflect their content or function.

:::

## Good enough practices *-* Tracking changes

-   Back up (almost) everything created by a human being as soon as it is created.
-   Keep changes small.
-   Share changes frequently.
-   Use a version control system.

# Data sharing

## FAIR principles and data sharing expectations

-   **F**indability
-   **A**ccessibility
-   **I**nteroperability
-   **R**euse of digital assets
:::

[go-fair.org](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)

## Our lab uses **Zenodo**

Zenodo is a "Generalist Repository"

![](images/zenodo.png)

::: incremental
-   Submissions are assigned Digital Object Identifiers (prevents link rot)
-   Versioned: DOIs for each version and one DOI linking to the most recent version
-   Rich metadata
-   Have it your way (any file format possible)
-   No weird file names forced upon you

**This is a big deal - and a requirement of NIH awards**

## A brief *informal* digest of NIH rules

::: incremental
-   Who: anyone funded in whole or part by NIH
-   What: data management plan (2 page: [link to template](https://grants.nih.gov/sites/default/files/DMS-Plan-blank-format-page.pdf){preview-link="true"}) must cover any data generated by their project (regardless of publication); default is open sharing; see also <https://dmptool.org/>
-   When: applications after Jan 25 2023 (not retroactive); data must be shared by earlier of publication or end of award
-   Where: into appropriate scientific repositories
-   Why: to improve science!

## Some Brown-specific resources

-   [CCV](https://ccv.brown.edu/): Brown's Center for Computation and Visualization
    -   Oscar - Brown's cluster (no PHI!); free 'exploratory' accounts
        -   Computational support via slack and Friday Zoom office hours
    -   [Open OnDemand (OOD)](https://ood.ccv.brown.edu/) - three clicks to RStudio on Oscar
        -   add 'git' to your modules list in the CCV form
-   Andrew Creamer - [Science Data Specialist in the Brown University Library](https://library.brown.edu/create/cds/people/andrew-creamer/)

## Summary

-   Reproducible research in epidemiology ***is*** complicated
-   There are many small steps you can take
-   You and your collaborators will be the biggest beneficiary
-   Our community is moving toward more open science and NIH is making a big push

## Bonus: loading a Rocker image (containers on OOD)

**Motivation**: get preconfigured docker containers running any version of R or complicated docker images (e.g., for bioinformatic or geospatial workflows) so they launch straight into RStudio on Oscar using OOD

![](images/rocker_logo.png){width="300"} [rocker-project.org](https://rocker-project.org/)

## Step-by-step instructions

1.  open a terminal on Oscar (*requires shibboleth login*)

    <https://ood.ccv.brown.edu/pun/sys/shell/ssh/oscar2>

2.  request an interactive session (*you may need more RAM - this is 10GB*):

    `interact -n 1 -t 02:00:00 -m 10g`

3.  pull a container locally into a SIF format (*maybe make a folder*)

    this example is for the base rstudio rocker image running R 4.5.1:

    `singularity pull docker://rocker/rstudio:4.5.1`

4.  start '**RStudio on Singularity**' Interactive App with path (*ends with .sif*)
